		<p>Police received an <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/350419455/weather-delays-rescue-two-people-aoraki-mt-cook">initial call for help from the pair at 2.45pm on Tuesday</a>, but have been unable to reach them due to weather conditions.</p>

		<p>The climbers are holed up in a remote alpine hut, but police would not confirm where on the mountain they are located.</p>

		<p>On Wednesday afternoon, a police spokesperson said the pair were unlikely to be able to be rescued as Search and Rescue personnel had been unable to reach them.</p></div>
